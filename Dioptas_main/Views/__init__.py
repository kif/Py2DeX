# TODO pressed buttons have to be shown differently (somehow the keyword does not work right now in the QT stylesheets)
#TODO the scrollbar needs to be with correct background (just setting it will disable the current look)
#TODO spinboxes should have rounded corners. This resets the original look --> need our own images etc.
